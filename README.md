# Gold-Price-Prediction in red

This program is an end-to-end project on developing a Machine Learning model for the Gold price. The specification requirements are pandas, yahoofinancials, and SQL.

## 1. Scarping data

To this end, one should run the file "**1_ETL_Fin_Asset_Prices.py**". Indeed, it is an ETL process for data on the daily Gold price from the Yahoo Finance site. In the end, the transformed data will be loaded to a SQL database. Also, this transformed data is stored in two CSV and excel files.

## 2. Cleansing data

To this end, one should run the file "**2_ETL_Fin_Asset_Prices.py**". Indeed, it is an ETL process of preparing data for training a Machine Learning model, in particular, computing the percent returns of the daily Gold prices. In the end, the finalized data will be loaded to a SQL database. Also, this finalized data is stored in two CSV and excel files.

## 3. Training Machine Learning Models
